# Hello-World
WOW, repositories are easy

My name is Jon Wright.  I live in Jacksonville Florida in the great USA.  I am an amateur programmer and would consider
myself proficient in the fundamentals of C# and a novice in JavaScript.  I broke the ice in my coding journey a few weeks ago 
with an old Bob Tabor C# fundamentals course now I am officially hooked.  Today I started my plural sight membership and am 
doing both the C# and The JavaScript development paths.  Tonight I will be starting a Youtube channel and a twitter account 
so that I can  interact with some of my favorite programmers and interact with other new comers.  My personal goal after 
completing these courses is to join a local meet up group of programmers and work on some group projects.  I am doing this 
all in the spirit of fun and fellowship and appreciate deeply the openness of the developer community.
